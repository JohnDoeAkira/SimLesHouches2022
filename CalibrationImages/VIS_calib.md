# VIS calibration images simulation

The SIM PF does not only simulate science images but also all the necessary calibration products that 
are required to operate the instrument and calibrate the data. Here we focus on three of the detector calibrations : 
the Bias, the Dark abd the Flatfield.

The calibration images are simulated the same way the science images are. The only difference is the 
enabled / disabled feature.

You can copy these wordir on your local directory abd run them by adapting the scripts from the science images.
